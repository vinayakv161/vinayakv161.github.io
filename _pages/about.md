I am a PhD candidate at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu) working with [ShenoyLab](https://shenoy.seas.upenn.edu). I am currently working with concepts from Physics, Biology and Computer Science to tackle problems in chromatin configuration.

In the past I have tried working on various topics ranging from Hyperbolic Metamaterials and Astronomy to DNA nanoelectronics. There exists an [older web page],(https://sites.google.com/view/vinayak161/) which consists of many of my failed attempts at research from my undergrad. Watch out this space for future updates!
