I am a PhD candidate at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu) working with the [Shenoy Research Group](https://shenoy.seas.upenn.edu). I am also a member of the [NSF Center for Engineering Mechanobiology](https://cemb.upenn.edu). Previously, I was a research assistant at [ICTS, Bangalore](https://www.icts.res.in). I did my undergrad at [IISc, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in) in physics with a thesis at JNCASR(https://www.jncasr.ac.in/home). 

My current research focuses on understanding how the chromatin organisation inside the nucleus and genetic regulation of the cell changes in response to different chemo-mechanical ques. My main focus remains on changes driven by variation in the microenvironment stiffness. In general I am interested in computational modelling of biological systems and material systems, materials- and bio-informatics and the Indian monsoon. I am happy to talk about any and all, so please reach out!
