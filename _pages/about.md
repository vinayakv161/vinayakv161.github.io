I am a second year PhD candidate at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu) working with the [Shenoy Research Group](https://shenoy.seas.upenn.edu). I am also a member of the [NSF Center for Engineering Mechanobiology](https://cemb.upenn.edu). Previously, I was a research assistant at [ICTS, Bangalore](https://www.icts.res.in). I did my undergrad at [IISc, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in) in physics with a thesis at [JNCASR](https://www.jncasr.ac.in/home). 

My current research is focused on delving into the physics underlying chromatin organization within the nucleus and the alterations in genetic regulation that occur in response to diverse chemo-mechanical cues. Of particular interest are the changes driven by variations in microenvironmental stiffness. To investigate these phenomena, I employ a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, numerical analysis, and machine learning tools to construct models for organization. Moreover, I leverage the power of sequencing and STORM imaging techniques to validate the predictions generated by my computational models. This multidisciplinary approach allows me to obtain experimental results that confirm the accuracy of my computational findings.

In addition to my specific research interests, I am generally fascinated by computational modeling in the realms of biological and condensed matter systems. Another area that captivates my attention is the study of the Indian monsoon, where computational techniques can provide valuable insights. Furthermore, I am intrigued by the applications of machine learning in these diverse fields. I am always enthusiastic about discussing any topics within these domains, so please do not hesitate to get in touch with me. I look forward to engaging in stimulating conversations!
