I am a PhD candidate at the [University of Pennsylvania] (https://www.upenn.edu) department working with [ShenoyLab] (https://shenoy.seas.upenn.edu). My work here dabbles between Physics, Biology and some Computer Science. 

In the past I have tried working on various topics ranging from Hyperbolic Metamaterials and Astronomy to DNA nanoelectronics. There exists an [older web page] (https://sites.google.com/view/vinayak161/) of me which consists of many musing from my undergrad. Watch out this space for future updates!
