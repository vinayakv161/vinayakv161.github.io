I am a second year PhD candidate at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu) working with the [Shenoy Research Group](https://shenoy.seas.upenn.edu). I am also a member of the [NSF Center for Engineering Mechanobiology](https://cemb.upenn.edu). Previously, I was a research assistant at [ICTS, Bangalore](https://www.icts.res.in). I did my undergrad at [IISc, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in) in physics with a thesis at [JNCASR](https://www.jncasr.ac.in/home). 

My current research focuses on understanding the physics behind chromatin organisation in the nucleus and changes in genetic regulation of the cell in response to different chemo-mechanical ques. Changes driven by variation in the microenvironment stiffness are of most interest. I use molecular dynamics, numerical analysis and machine learning based tools to study the underlying phenomenon. In general I am interested in computational modelling of biological systems and condensed matter systems, the Indian monsoon and the use of machine learning in these fields. I am happy to talk about any and all, so feel free to reach out!
