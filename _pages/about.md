I am a second year PhD candidate at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu) working with the [Shenoy Research Group](https://shenoy.seas.upenn.edu). I am also a member of the [NSF Center for Engineering Mechanobiology](https://cemb.upenn.edu). Previously, I was a research assistant at [ICTS, Bangalore](https://www.icts.res.in). I did my undergrad at [IISc, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in) in physics with a thesis at [JNCASR](https://www.jncasr.ac.in/home). 

I research the physics of chromatin organization in the nucleus, focusing on genetic regulation changes due to chemo-mechanical cues, particularly variations in microenvironmental stiffness. I use molecular dynamics simulations, numerical analysis, and machine learning tools to construct models and validate them through sequencing and STORM imaging techniques. I'm also interested in computational modeling in biology and condensed matter systems, the study of the Indian monsoon, and the applications of machine learning in these fields. Feel free to reach out to discuss these topicsâ€”I enjoy engaging in stimulating conversations!
