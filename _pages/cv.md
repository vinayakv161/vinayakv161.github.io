Education
=========
* PhD candidate in Materials Science and Engineering 
  * University of Pennsylvania, 2021 - Present
* B.S.(Research), *First Class with Distinction* in Physics 
  * Indian Institute of Science, 2016 - 2020 

Work experience
===============
* Graduate Research Fellow  
  Univeristy of Pennsylvania (2021-Present)
  * Project: Using MD to predict the 3D chromatin configuration
        * Working on a polymer model to predict the change in 3D conformation of nuclear chromatin in response to external stimuli. The model also predicts changes in the epigenetic distribution and therefore the genetic regulation of the simulated region.  
* Research Assistant  
  International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bangalore (2020-21)  
  * Worked on using a data-centric approach to study the Indian Monsoon. Mainly considere
* Undergraduate thesis  
  Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bangalore (2019-2020)
  * Worked on a Materials informatics project involving modeling of materials using Graph Neural Networks.
  * Modeled DNA conduction using FFNN to bypass bottleneck DFT calculations.
* Research intern  
  University of Manchester (2019) and National Centre Radio Astrophysics (2018)
  * Worked on the SKA pipeline to build a streaming algorithm for sifting (UoM).
  * Used novel data processing techniques to study pulsar dynamics (NCRA).
