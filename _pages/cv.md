Education
=========
* PhD candidate in Materials Science and Engineering 
  * University of Pennsylvania, 2021 - Present
* B.S.(Research), *First Class with Distinction* in Physics 
  * Indian Institute of Science, 2016 - 2020 

Work experience
===============
* Graduate Research Fellow  
  Univeristy of Pennsylvania (2021-Present)
  * _Using MD to predict the 3D chromatin configuration_: Working on a polymer model to predict the change in 3D conformation of nuclear chromatin in response to external stimuli. The model also predicts changes in the epigenetic distribution and therefore the genetic regulation of the simulated region. The model brings out how the underlying physics governs the biological processes and leads to the emergence of large scale structures and funtions from local interactions.
  * _Effect of substrate stiffness on genomic and epigenetic regulation_: Through wet lab experiments, we are trying to figure out how substrate stiffness affects the genetic regulation of non-cancerous and cancerous cells. Which are the prime genes which are up and down regulated to adapt the cell to stiffer and softer conditions, a central question to understand the metastatic cascade.    
* Research Assistant  
  International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bangalore (2020-21)  
  * Data-driven modeling of the Indian Monsoon: Initially used 
* Undergraduate thesis  
  Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bangalore (2019-2020)
  * Worked on a Materials informatics project involving modeling of materials using Graph Neural Networks.
  * Modeled DNA conduction using FFNN to bypass bottleneck DFT calculations.
* Summer visiting undergraduate researcher  
  University of Manchester (2019) and National Centre Radio Astrophysics (2018)
  * Worked on the SKA pipeline to build a streaming algorithm for sifting (UoM).
  * Used novel data processing techniques to study pulsar dynamics (NCRA). 
* Research student
  National Centre for Radio Astrophysics(NCRA), Pune and Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope(GMRT), Khodad (2018-19)
